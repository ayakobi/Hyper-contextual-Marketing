Hyper-contextual-Marketing

Hyper-contextual targeting has been a popular and effective advertisement tool due to global digitalization. To enhance customer responses to marketing campaigns, companies have been collecting data and exploiting not only customer characteristics but also environmental factors. The main contextual factor that is analyzed in this research, is crowdedness in public transport. 
To asses the effects of variations in crowdedness on purchase likelihood, the Causal Forest algorithm is implemented (Athey, Tibshirani, Wager, et al. 2019). 
This Machine Learning technique estimates heterogeneous treatment effects and allows for statistical inference. This research constructs a simulation framework that models customer heterogeneity and the non-linear effects of crowdedness.
Below, you can find the implementation of the simulation framework and the Casual Forest from the grf-package in R.
